abstract = {Most current models for finite deformation viscoelasticity are restricted to linear evolution laws for the viscous material behaviour. In this paper, we present a model for finite deformation viscoelasticity that utilizes a nonlinear evolution law, and thus is not restricted to states close to the thermodynamic equilibrium. We further show that upon appropriate linearization, we can recover several established models of finite linear viscoelasticity and linear viscoelasticity. The utilization of this model in a computational setting is also addressed and examples are presented to highlight the differences of the proposed model in relation with other available models. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Detailed knowledge of the dynamic viscoelastic properties of bone is required to understand the mechanisms of macroscopic bone fracture in humans, and other terrestrial mammals, during impact loading events (e.g. falls, vehicle accidents, etc.). While the dynamic response of bone has been studied for several decades, high-quality data remain limited, and it is only within the last decade that techniques for conducting dynamic compression tests on bone at near-constant strain rates have been developed. Furthermore, there appears to be a lack of published bone data in the intermediate strain rate (ISR) range (i.e. 1-100 s-1), which represents a regime in which many dynamic bone fractures occur. In this paper, preliminary results for the dynamic compression of bovine cortical bone in the ISR regime are presented. The results are obtained using two Hopkinsonbar-related techniques, namely the conventional split Hopkinson bar arrangement incorporating a novel cone-in-tube striker design, and the recently developed wedge bar apparatus. The experimental results show a rapid transition in the strain rate sensitive behaviour of bovine cortical bone in the ISR range. Finally, a new viscoelastic model is proposed that captures the observed transition behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},
